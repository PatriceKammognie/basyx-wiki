# Registry Interface

The BaSys 4.0 Registry enables registration and lookup of Asset Administration Shells within defined system boundaries. Entities that provide Asset Administration Shells including their submodels may register and hence enable other participants to find them. The necessary information required for registration amongst others are unique identifiers for the Asset Administration Shell and its respective Asset, endpoint information regarding the Asset Administration Shell's API and its submodels service providers.

We use Swagger to document our core APIs. The complete registry API is documented [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/BaSyx/BaSyx_Registry_API/v1#/)
