An Asset Administration Shell is a "standardized digital representation of the asset, corner stone of the interoperability between the applications managing the manufacturing systems. It identifies the Administration Shell and the assets represented by it, holds digital models of various aspects (submodels) and describes technical functionality exposed by the Administration Shell or respective assets." (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 13, [[1](https://wiki.eclipse.org/BaSyx_/_Documentation_/_API_/_AssetAdministrationShell)])

An Asset is defined as "physical or logical object owned by or under the custodial duties of an organization, having either a perceived or actual value to the organization" (Details of the Asset Administration Shell, 2018, p. 12, [[2](https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/Publikation/2018-verwaltungsschale-im-detail.pdf)])
